SAXS_toolbox is a flexible platform dedicated to reduction (i.e. calibration and integration) of X-ray scattering images (SAXS, WAXS, diffraction,...). 
It is developped in Python 3 and is based on pyFAI library. It was developped with the aim of producing corrected and calibrated 2D scattering images.
Check Documentation and tutorial for more information.
This first release allows to perform transmission corrections, calibration and integration of 2D images. Nowadays, since recent detectors perform automatic transmission corrections, a lighter version was produced, named SAXS_toolbox_II.
