SAXS_toolbox is a flexible platform dedicated to reduction (i.e. calibration and integration) of X-ray scattering images (SAXS, WAXS, diffraction,...). 
It is developped in Python 3 and is based on pyFAI library. It was developped with the aim of producing corrected and calibrated 2D scattering images, with the idea of keeping the highest level of information when dealing with anisotropic data.
The algorithm can treat batch of images, but individually optimizes the reference substraction to obtain high quality data.
Export of images in ascii format Qx, Qy, Intensity is also made available (the output format is compatible with sasview).
